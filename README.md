# Boston-Crime-Mapping-Analysis

I went about building this notebook to gain more experience with the analyzes of geospatial data, developing interactive maps, and due to a general interest in crime statistics.

The datasets used were from the [Crime Incident Reports in Boston](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/jinbonnie/crime-incident-reports-in-boston) and [Boston Police Districts](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/christotk/boston-police-districts) datasets on Kaggle

The following shows a gif of the interactive map of boston crime geospatial data:
